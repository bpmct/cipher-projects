# Hello!

### I didn't want to do this by hand for my homework...

so I created this python program to do it for me!!

It was actually a lot more difficult than I thought it would be :cry: but I also really enjoyed making it and learned a ton and also am happy with how it turned out.

## So yea cheers to my first completed python project! :tada:

Always open to any sort of feedback :smile:
